    "# 1. Alzheimer's disease: an ongoing challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alzheimer's disease (AD)** is a neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and progressively worsens. It is the cause of 60–70% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events. As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, self-neglect, and behavioral issues. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the typical life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Beta amyloid A4 protein** ([Uniprot](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P05067/entry#structure)), also known as amyloid-beta (Aβ), is a key component involved in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) ([Nature Reviews Neurology](http://www.nature.com/articles/nrneurol.2009.219)). Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Alzheimer's disease, there is an abnormal accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. The accumulation of Aβ plaques is believed to trigger a series of pathological events that contribute to the neurodegeneration seen in Alzheimer's disease. Aβ peptides can aggregate to form insoluble plaques, which can disrupt neuronal function, cause inflammation, and lead to the death of brain cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "The precise mechanisms by which Aβ leads to neurodegeneration are still under investigation, but the accumulation of Aβ and its subsequent effects on brain function are considered central to the disease pathology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerous therapeutic approaches have been developed to target Aβ, such as anti-Aβ antibodies, beta-secretase inhibitors, and gamma-secretase modulators. The goal of these treatments is to reduce the production, aggregation, or enhance the clearance of Aβ in order to slow down or halt the progression of Alzheimer's disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "it's important to note that while targeting Aβ has shown promise in preclinical studies, clinical trials have been met with mixed results, and the development of effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease remains a significant challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the basis of preclinical studies and the limited data from clinical trials, **Aβ immunotherapy** might be most effective in preventing or slowing the progression of AD when patients are immunized before or in the very earliest stages of disease onset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the identification of a molecule capable of leveraging this function is crucial for the development of future clinical therapies. Computational drug discovery, as well as quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) and machine learning techniques, are fundamental in this endeavor."

Lipinski analyzed all orally active FDA-approved drugs in the formulation of what is to be known as the **Rule-of-Five** or **Lipinski's Rule**:"
